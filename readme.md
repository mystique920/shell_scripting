# Beginner Shell Scripting Course

## Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to shell scripting on macOS, covering the fundamental concepts and skills needed to automate tasks and manage your system effectively. The course is designed for beginners with no prior experience in shell scripting or programming.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with using a computer and command line interface.
- A macOS system with Terminal installed.
- A text editor such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar.
- No prior programming experience required.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the course repository.
2. Ensure you have a working shell environment (typically Bash on macOS).
3. Open the repository in your favorite text editor.
4. Run shell scripts directly from the Terminal to practice commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand core shell scripting concepts and commands.
- Write, execute, and debug shell scripts.
- Automate routine tasks using shell commands.
- Implement basic control flow structures and functions in scripts.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four weeks, each covering specific topics and building upon the knowledge gained in previous weeks.

### Week 1: Introduction to Shell Scripting

- What is shell scripting?
- Why use shell scripting?
- Basic shell commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`)
- Working with files and directories
- Creating and executing simple shell scripts
- Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
- `echo` command
- Comments

### Week 2: Variables and Input/Output

- Variables: declaring, assigning, and using variables
- Data types (strings, numbers)
- Command substitution
- User input (`read` command)
- Output redirection and piping
- `printf` command
- Command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- Environment variables (brief comparison with Python's `os.environ`)

### Week 3: Control Flow and Logic

- Conditional statements (`if`, `then`, `else`, `elif`, `fi`)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Looping (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- Case statements
- Using `find` with `-exec` (similar to Python's `os.walk` for traversing directories)
- Comparative examples with Python (conditional statements and loops)

### Week 4: Functions and Advanced Topics

- Defining and calling functions
- Passing arguments to functions
- Returning values from functions
- Working with arrays
- String manipulation
- Error handling
- Debugging shell scripts
- Introduction to `awk` and `sed` for text processing
- Creating simple command-line tools (comparison with Python's `argparse` module)
- Regular expressions (comparison with Python's `re` module)
