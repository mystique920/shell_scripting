# Introduction to cat

`cat` is a command-line utility that is used to display the contents of one or more files in the terminal. It is short for "concatenate."

**Basic Syntax:**

```bash
cat [options] [file(s)]
```

**Example:**

To display the contents of a file named `example.txt`:

```bash
cat example.txt
```

**Common Options:**

*   `-n`: Number the output lines, starting at 1.
*   `-b`: Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.
*   `-s`: Suppress repeated empty output lines.

`cat` is commonly used for viewing small files, concatenating files, and redirecting output to other commands.
